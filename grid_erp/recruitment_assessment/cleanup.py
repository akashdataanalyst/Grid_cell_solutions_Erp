"""Delete an Assessment Assignment together with everything recorded under it.

Assignment and Attempt link to each other (Attempt.assignment, Assignment.current_attempt), so
Frappe's normal delete is blocked either way. This deletes them in a safe order:

    Assessment Result, Snapshot, Recording, Notification
    → Assessment Attempt (answers, violations and audit logs are its child tables)
    → Assessment Assignment

All of it runs in the request's single transaction: if any step fails, nothing is deleted.
Uploaded files (videos, recordings, snapshots) are detached first and only removed from disk by a
background job that is queued after the commit, because deleting a File removes it from disk at once.

Only for wrong or test assignments. Real candidates' records are hiring evidence; to give a
candidate another test use "Assign Another Assessment" instead.
